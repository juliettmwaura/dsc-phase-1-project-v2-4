**Authors:** Juliet Mwaura **



# A) INTRODUCTION
In a time where original visual content is growing, understanding what the trend is and popular visual content is important for Microsoft's venture into the movie industry. This project looks at the different types of movies that are doing well, what people seem to enjoy the most and offering actionable insights for Microsoft to employ in this new venture.
# B) PROBLEM STATEMENT
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.
# C) MAIN OBJECTIVE
The main objective is to identify popular box office trends and audience preferences, providing actionable insights for Microsoft's new movie studio to create compelling, commercially successful films that resonate with audiences and differentiate the brand in the market.

## 2. Business Understanding
Microsoft wants to begin a new venture in the film industry without prior expertise and knowledge. Therefore, this analysis aims to answer the following key data questions:

1. **Which studio movies are most watched ?**
   - Analyzing the studios performing well enables us to better what they do and even provide a chance for collaboration regarding creating film content.

2. **Which film genres have consistently performed well at the box office in recent years?**
   - Understanding the top-performing genres provides critical insights into market trends and audience preferences, guiding Microsoft's studio toward potentially lucrative areas of production.

2. **What is the relationship between production_budgets and gross(earnings)?**
   - Analyzing revenue trends in relation to the gross(earnings) helps quantify the financial potential and profitability of specific film types, enabling informed decisions on investment allocation.


## 3. Data Understanding
The data utilized for this project is sourced from comprehensive databases such as the box office movies,the numbers and market research on film performances.These sources offer insights into film success metrics relevant to our analysis.

The dataset encompasses a broad range of films released in recent years, with information such as film title, release date, genre categorization, box office revenue, production budget, audience demographics (age, gender, location), critical ratings, and perhaps viewer ratings. All these information allows for comprehensive analysis and exploration of correlations between genres, revenues, audience characteristics, and critical reception, thus being a firm foundation for deriving actionable insights to guide Microsoft's movie studio endeavors.

## 4. Data Preparation/Cleaning

In preparing the data for analysis, several steps were taken to ensure the data's quality, relevance, and reliability. Here's an overview of the data preparation process and the reasoning behind it:

a)Checking for missing data. There are two ways which this could be handles which is either use the meadian as the missing values or drop the rows or columns with high percentage of missing values or critical information.

b)Checking for outliers.

c)Checking for duplicates.

The data preparation process was critical to ensuring that the subsequent analysis provided meaningful insights guiding decision-making for Microsoft's new movie studio venture.

## 5. Data Analysis and Evaluation
#### a) Genre and rating
From the visualization above comparing each genre with the ratings we get to see that the top three performing genres are:-

*Adventure,Animation,Comedy

*Biography,Drama

*Action,Crime,Drama

Investing in these genres could prove profitable as they are highly rated by the audience thus highly prefered

#### b) top performing studios
From the visualization above comparing each studio with the earnings we get to see that the top three performing studios in both domestic and foreign markets. Domestic market top 3 are:-

*(P/DW)-Paramount Pictures/Dream Works

*(BV)-Buena Vista

*Sony

(P/DW)-Paramount Pictures/Dream Works seems to be doing well in both foreign and domestic market thus a well performing studio.
Microsoft can partner and collaborate with this top performing studios will enhance chances of producing movies with high revenues as we can capitalize on their existing success and market presence.
#### c) budget vs earnings
From the visualization above comparing the production budget with the worldwide gross we get to see that the higher the production budget the higher the worldwide gross (revenue)

## 6. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, this analysis has provided valuable insights on the top performing studios for collaboration, the top genres that the market seems to prefer and the relationship between the budget and the revenue of these movies. However, it's essential to continuously validate and update these insights to ensure their ongoing relevance in an ever-evolving entertainment landscape.

## 7. RECOMMENDATIONS
From this analysis, I would recommend Microsoft to implement the following steps as they would aid in Microsoft successful venture into creation of video content:
## 1.Work with large studios
Microsoft should aim to partner or even collaborate with established and larger film studios such as Paramount pictures/Dream Works(P/DW) and the other top studios froboth domestic and foreign market as this enhances the chance of producing movies with high revenues.
## 2.Market Analysis
Microsoft should produce the genres that are most highly rated are Adventure,Animation,Comedy,Biography,Drama,Action,Crime,Drama as they are likely to bring in good returns .Monitoring of industry trends and audience preferences and performance of other movie sites to make informed decisions and adapt to its strategies for sustained success as things change and the preferences evolve with time.
## 3.Strategic investments
From our analysis we have seen that the higher the production budget , the higher the worldwide gross therefore it is important for Microsoft to consider strategic investments in the acquisitions of larger studios and/or the creation of the movies as it is correlated to their return on investment. 

## 8. LIMITATIONS
Some of the limitations of this analysis are:
### 1.Ever changing
Trends in the entertainment industry evolve rapidly. The analysis might reflect current preferences but could become outdated as audience tastes change.
### 2.Complex Factors
 Succeeding in the movie industry involves factors beyond data analysis, including marketing, timing, and creative aspects, which this analysis might not fully capture.

 ## 9. Next Steps
### 1. Continuous Analysis
More consistent analysis should be done to monitor the market trends, change i preferenes etc etc to easier adapt so as to be relevant and profitable.
### 2. Predictive analysis
Implenting advanced ways of analysis that can predict future trends etc can be crucial and make Microsoft stand out and become more profitable.
